# High level goals

0. Document results in progress/report-week-__n__.md
1. Show that diarization metrics do not capture short turns, propose a new metric
2. Show relevance of processing multi-channel audio for speaker diarization
3. Show relevance of processing multi-channel audio for ASR by improving/using:
   * Speech Activity Detection
   * Speaker segmentation
   * Overlap detection
   * Source separation
4. How do we do on diarization in the wild (HomeBank)
5. Social analysis of overlap and speaker changes in conversational speech

# Corpus, Baseline Models and Tools
## Training and development
AMI corpus, using Kaldi models and baseline for AMI.

## Testing

## Better Diarization Metrics
[Mark, Ken]



## Processing Multi-channel audio for better diarization
1. iVector generalization for multiple channels
2. Overlap detection

## Processing Multi-channel audio for better ASR
1. Source separation

## Diarization in the wild
1. HomeBank Analysis


## Social analysis

Week1 goals:
1. Propose Better Diarization Metrics [Mark]
2. See how the proposed metrics affects DER for AMI [Jan]
3. Standardize diarization tool. Pick one [Matthew, Jan]
4. iVector Generalization for multi-channel. See http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~ronw/pubs/taslp2017-multichannel.pdf for motivation [Sriram]
5. Source Separation using oracle segmentation on Beamformed channel, get WER/DER [Jun]
6. Use IHM, Array-mics to dereverb, get WER, DER
7. Social Analysis  [Zhou]
